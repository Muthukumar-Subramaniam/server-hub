## 🖥️ OS & Provisioning Support

### 🧠 Central infra Server OS

The central infra server runs on **AlmaLinux 10** by default.  
You can also customize it to use any **Red Hat-compatible distribution**, such as:

- **RHEL** (via developer subscription with minor tweaks)
- **Rocky Linux**
- **Oracle Linux**
- **CentOS Stream**

---

### 📦 VM Guest OS Provisioning

All VM provisioning is **centrally managed** by the central infra server using automation scripts and configuration templates.

The toolkit supports automated provisioning for VMs across all **three major Linux families**, with **ready-to-use configurations** included for:

| Distro Family    | Supported OSes                                | Provisioning Method           | Status                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Red Hat-based    | AlmaLinux                                      | Kickstart                     | ✅ Included by default   |
|                  | Rocky, Oracle Linux, RHEL, CentOS Stream       | Kickstart                     | 🔧 Customizable          |
| Debian-based     | Ubuntu LTS                                     | Cloud-init (`cloud-config`)   | ✅ Included by default   |
| SUSE-based       | openSUSE Leap                                  | AutoYaST                      | ✅ Included by default   |

> 🧪 This toolkit is designed for lab environments that require provisioning and managing heterogeneous Linux distributions for testing, experimentation, and development.

# Lab Setup for VMware Workstation :
---
## 💿 Install VMware Workstation Pro 17.5.x on Windows

VMware Workstation Pro is now available for free personal use. Here's how to get it:

### 🔐 1. Register at Broadcom

- Go to: [https://support.broadcom.com](https://support.broadcom.com)
- Click **Register** (top right)
- Create an account and verify your email

### ⬇️ 2. Download Workstation Pro

- Visit:  
  👉 [Download VMware Workstation Pro (Free)](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Workstation%20Pro&freeDownloads=true)

- Log in with your Broadcom account
- Download the Windows installer:  
  `VMware-Workstation-Full-17.5.x.exe`

### 🛠️ 3. Install

- Run the installer and complete the setup using default options

## 🌐 VMware Workstation Virtual Network Setup (Clean Lab Mode)

To maintain a deterministic and automation-friendly lab environment, the setup uses **a single custom virtual network** managed entirely by the central infra-server.

### 🔄 Reset Virtual Network Configuration

1. Open the **Virtual Network Editor** (admin/root privileges required):
   - **Windows**: Launch VMware Workstation as Administrator → `Edit` → `Virtual Network Editor`

2. **Remove all existing VM networks** (`vmnet1`, `vmnet8`, etc.)

### ➕ Create `vmnet0` – Clean NAT Network

1. Click **Add Network** → Select **`vmnet0`**

2. Configure the following:

| Setting                            | Value                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Network Type**                   | ✅ NAT                       |
| **Connect a Host Virtual Adapter** | ✅ Enabled                   |
| **Use local DHCP**                 | ❌ Disabled                  |
| **Subnet IP**                      | e.g., `10.10.20.0`           |
| **Subnet Mask**                    | `255.255.252.0` (`/22`)      |

3. Click the **“NAT Settings”** button  
   - Set the **Gateway IP** to the **first IP in the subnet**, e.g., `10.10.20.1`

4. ✅ Once everything is configured and verified, click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the network setup.

> 🧠 This creates a `/22` virtual lab network, managed entirely by your infra-server, with the first few IPs reserved for infrastructure components.
> 💡 You can use **any private /22 subnet**, such as `10.0.0.0/22`, `172.16.40.0/22`, or `192.168.50.0/22`.  
> Just ensure it does **not conflict with your LAN or VPN networks**.

### 🧠 IP Address Management & PXE Boot Strategy

- **Static IPs** are assigned to all VMs by the infra-server during provisioning.
- The **infra-server runs a DHCP server** used **only for PXE booting**, not for runtime address assignment.
- After boot/install, each VM configures its static IP permanently.
- No dynamic or runtime DHCP usage in normal operations.

### 🪟 Windows Host IP Configuration (VMnet0 Only)

For communication between the **Windows host** and the lab VMs:

1. Go to **Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network Connections**
2. Find the adapter: **`VMware Network Adapter VMnet0`**
3. Right-click → **Properties**
4. Select `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)` → Click **Properties**
5. Configure:

   - **IP Address**: `10.10.20.3`  
   - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.252.0`  
   - **Default Gateway**: *(leave blank)*  
   - **Preferred DNS Server**: *( leave blank - will update later with infra server VM's IP )*

> ✅ Once the infra-server is up, it will provide DNS and other services within the lab.

### 📌 IP Layout Summary

| IP Address       | Role               |
|------------------|--------------------|
| `10.10.20.1`     | VMware NAT gateway |
| `10.10.20.2`     | Infra-server       |
| `10.10.20.3`     | Windows host       |

> 🧪 This configuration gives you full control over VM lifecycle management, PXE booting, DNS, and networking in a clean lab setup — fully automated, predictable, and production-style.

      - Browse and select your **AlmaLinux 10 ISO**

  → Click **Close**, then click **Finish** to create the VM  
🕒 **Note**: Since disk space is pre-provisioned, VMware will take a few moments to create the VM. Please wait until the process completes.

## Post-Creation Tweaks of Infra-Server VM (Edit VM Settings)

After the infra-server VM is created, follow these steps to tweak its settings before booting:

1. **Open the VM Settings:**

   - In **VMware Workstation**, locate your `infra-server` VM in the left pane  
   - **Right-click** on the VM → Select **Settings**  
     *(or select the VM and click **Edit virtual machine settings** from the right pane)*

2. **Disable Side Channel Mitigations (for Hyper-V enabled hosts):**

   - Go to the **Options** tab  
   - Select **Advanced**  
   - Under **Settings**, ✅ **Check**: `Disable side channel mitigations for Hyper-V enabled hosts`

   > ⚠️ This option improves performance when running VMware Workstation on a **Windows host with Hyper-V enabled**.  
   > Best suited for lab/test setups — not recommended for production workloads due to reduced CPU-level security mitigations.

3. **Set Firmware Type to UEFI (without Secure Boot):**

   - Still under **Options → Advanced**
   - Under **Firmware type**:
     - ✅ Select: **UEFI**
     - 🔲 Do **not** check: **Enable secure boot**

   > ℹ️ Secure Boot is not required for lab provisioning and may interfere with PXE boot or custom OS installs.

 4. **Save the Settings:**

   - Click **OK** to save and apply all changes
