# 🧠 Kubernetes Networking Fundamentals

## 🚀 Foundational Principle: **No NAT**

Kubernetes **assumes**:

> Every Pod gets a unique IP address, and **can communicate directly with every other Pod IP** across the cluster **without NAT (Network Address Translation)**.

This simplifies things compared to traditional network models and forms the basis for Kubernetes’ flat networking model.

---

## 🔗 Container-to-Container Communication (Within the Same Pod)

### 🔧 Setup:

- All containers in a Pod share:
  - The same **network namespace**
  - The same **loopback interface (`lo`)**
  - The same **IP address**

### ↺ How it works:

- Communication is like talking over `localhost`
- E.g., NGINX in container A can talk to Redis in container B using `localhost:6379`

📦 **Use Case**: Sidecar containers, logging agents, or service mesh proxies.

---

## 📡 Pod-to-Pod Communication (Same Node)

### 🔧 Setup:

- Each Pod is assigned a **unique IP**
- The Pod network is implemented by a **CNI plugin** (e.g., Calico, Flannel, Cilium)
- Pods on the same node use **virtual Ethernet interfaces (veth pairs)**

### ↺ How it works:

1. Each Pod connects to a **bridge** (e.g., `cni0`)
2. Traffic is routed **locally** between veth interfaces
3. Packets move via the **host Linux bridge** (Layer 2) or virtual routing

📦 **No NAT**, no extra hop — it’s direct Pod IP to Pod IP within the same node.

---

## 🌐 Pod-to-Pod Communication (Different Nodes)

### 🔧 Setup:

- Pod IPs are unique cluster-wide
- Nodes are connected via a **virtual overlay network** or **routing fabric** provided by CNI (e.g., VXLAN, IP-in-IP, BGP)

### ↺ How it works:

1. Pod on `Node A` sends packet to Pod on `Node B`
2. The source Pod sends the packet with the **destination Pod IP**
3. **Node A’s kubelet or CNI plugin** routes the packet out through the node’s main interface
4. Packet is **encapsulated** (if overlay) and sent to Node B
5. Node B’s CNI **decapsulates and delivers** the packet to the target Pod

✅ Still **no NAT**, direct Pod-to-Pod even across nodes.

---

## 📧 Node-to-Node Communication (Cluster Networking)

### 🔧 Node communication is crucial for:

- CNI traffic
- Control plane access (API server ↔ kubelet)
- Metrics, DNS, etc.

### ↺ How it works:

- Nodes must be able to **reach each other’s Pod CIDRs**
- Can be routed (Calico with BGP) or encapsulated (Flannel with VXLAN)

📦 Example:

- Node A wants to reach `10.244.2.5` (Pod on Node B)
- If routed: Node A sends via physical interface, Linux routing table handles it
- If overlay: Node A encapsulates and sends via tunnel

---

## 🌍 External-to-Cluster Communication (Access from Outside)

### 🧭 Entry Points:

1. **NodePort**
2. **LoadBalancer**
3. **Ingress Controller**
4. **Port-forwarding / kubectl proxy (dev-only)**

---

### 1. 🔌 NodePort Service

- Opens a static port (e.g., 30080) on every node
- External clients hit `nodeIP:nodePort`
- Requests get routed to the backend Pod

📉 Not ideal for production (manual port range, exposed on all nodes)

---

### 2. 🌐 LoadBalancer Service (Cloud Only)

- Provisioned via **cloud provider’s external LB**
- Sends traffic to NodePort automatically
- Best for exposing services publicly in cloud environments

---

### 3. 🚪 Ingress + Ingress Controller

- Acts as **Layer 7 (HTTP) reverse proxy**
- Routes requests by host/path to services
- Typically backed by NGINX, Traefik, or HAProxy
- Great for domain-based routing like `api.myapp.local`, `app.myapp.local`

---

### 4. 🧪 kubectl port-forward / proxy

- Dev-only tools for debugging
- Not used for real networking

---

## 📦 Service-to-Pod Communication

Services provide **stable virtual IPs (ClusterIP)** that front multiple Pods.

- Uses **kube-proxy** (iptables or IPVS mode)
- Load balances traffic to Pod backends via round-robin
- Service IP is internal-only unless exposed via NodePort/LB/Ingress

---

## ↺ DNS Resolution

- Each Service gets a DNS entry via **CoreDNS**
- Example: `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`
- Pods resolve service names to ClusterIPs via DNS

| Scope                   | Communication Style            | NAT? | Comment                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---- | ----------------------- |
| Containers in same Pod  | Loopback (`localhost`)         | ❌    | Share net namespace     |
| Pods on same node       | Virtual bridge / veth pairs    | ❌    | Routed via local bridge |
| Pods on different nodes | CNI overlay / routed           | ❌    | Depends on plugin       |
| Node to Node            | Physical / overlay / BGP       | ❌    | Must be routable        |
| External to Pod         | NodePort / LB / Ingress        | ✅/❌  | Depends on method       |
| Service to Pod          | kube-proxy + iptables          | ❌    | Handles load balancing  |
| DNS                     | CoreDNS resolves service names | ❌    | Cluster-internal FQDN   |
