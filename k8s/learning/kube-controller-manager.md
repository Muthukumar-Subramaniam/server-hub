## ðŸ”¹ What is kube-controller-manager?

The `kube-controller-manager` is a **core control plane component** responsible for running **Kubernetes controllers** â€” background loops that **watch the cluster state and drive it toward the desired state**.

Each controller continuously:
1. **Monitors** cluster state via the API server
2. **Compares** it with the desired state (defined in specs)
3. **Takes action** to reconcile the differences (create, update, delete)
