# ðŸ“¡ kube-apiserver â€“ The Heart of the Kubernetes Control Plane

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is kube-apiserver?

The `kube-apiserver` is the **core component of the Kubernetes control plane** that exposes the **Kubernetes API**.   
It acts as the **central communication hub** for all cluster operations.  

- It is the **entry point** for all external and internal requests to the cluster.
- Every command or control signal goes through the API server.
- It is a **RESTful service** that speaks HTTP(S) and serves JSON or YAML.

## ðŸ”¹ Responsibilities of kube-apiserver

1. **API Gateway**  
   - Serves all Kubernetes APIs (e.g., Pods, Deployments, Services).
   - Routes requests to the appropriate control plane component.

2. **Authentication**  
   - Validates the identity of the request sender.
   - Supports tokens, client certs, OIDC, etc.

3. **Authorization**  
   - Checks if the authenticated user is permitted to perform the requested action.

5. **Object Validation**  
   - Ensures all API requests are schema-compliant before persisting.

6. **Persistence to etcd**  
   - Writes valid and accepted Kubernetes objects into the etcd datastore.
   - Reads cluster state from etcd to serve requests.
