## üß© [What is a Container?](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)

At its core, a **container is just a Linux process** ‚Äî but with special powers:
- It thinks it‚Äôs running on its own dedicated system.
- It sees only what it's allowed to see.
- It uses only the resources it‚Äôs allowed to use.

## üß† Linux Magic That Makes Containers Work

### üß± A. Namespaces ‚Äì *Isolation*

Namespaces make a container feel like it‚Äôs the only process on the system.

| Namespace | What It Isolates            |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| PID       | Process IDs                 |
| NET       | Network interfaces, IPs     |
| MNT       | Mounted filesystems         |
| UTS       | Hostname and domain name    |
| IPC       | Interprocess communication  |
| USER      | User and group IDs          |

> **Example**: A process inside a container sees itself as PID 1, even if it‚Äôs a high-numbered PID on the host.

---

### üìä B. cgroups (Control Groups) ‚Äì *Resource Control*

cgroups limit how much of the host‚Äôs resources a container can use.

| Resource | What You Can Limit            |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| CPU      | CPU shares or quotas          |
| Memory   | RAM usage                     |
| Disk I/O | Read/write speed or priority  |
| Network  | (with extra tools)            |

> **Example**: Restrict a container to 512MB RAM and 0.5 CPU cores.

# üöÄ What is a Container Runtime?

A **container runtime** is low-level software that:

- **Creates**, **runs**, and **manages** containers
- Uses Linux kernel features like namespaces and cgroups
- Handles image unpacking, file system mounting, networking, etc.

It‚Äôs the **engine** that makes containers possible behind the scenes.

## üîß Types of Container Runtimes

There are two main categories of container runtimes:

### 1. High-Level Runtimes

These offer user-friendly tools, manage container images, and provide APIs.

| Runtime         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Docker**      | Full-featured CLI + daemon. Includes image builds, container management, volumes, networks, etc. |
| **containerd**  | Industry-standard runtime. Extracted from Docker. Used by Kubernetes and other tools. |
| **CRI-O**       | Lightweight runtime for Kubernetes. Implements CRI for kubelet to talk directly to OCI-compliant runtimes. |
| **Podman**      | Daemonless and rootless container engine. Docker-compatible CLI. developed and maintained by Red Hat. |
| **LXC/LXD**     | Linux Containers. LXC is low-level; LXD is a higher-level REST API and CLI to manage containers and system containers (more like VMs). |

---

### 2. Low-Level (OCI-Compliant) Runtimes

These handle the actual creation and running of container processes.

| Runtime         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **runc**        | Default runtime for Docker and containerd. Reference implementation of OCI Runtime Spec. |
| **crun**        | A faster runtime written in C. Used in Red Hat-based systems. |
| **gVisor**      | A secure, sandboxed runtime by Google. Adds user-space kernel isolation. |
| **Kata Containers** | Runs containers inside lightweight VMs for better isolation and security. |

---

## üéØ Container Runtimes in Kubernetes

- Kubernetes does **not run containers directly**.
- It uses the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** to talk to runtimes.
- Popular CRI-compatible runtimes:
  - `containerd`
  - `CRI-O`
  - `Docker Engine`
  - `Mirantis Container Runtime`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è As of Kubernetes v1.24, **Docker is no longer supported** as a runtime. Use `containerd` or `CRI-O` instead.
